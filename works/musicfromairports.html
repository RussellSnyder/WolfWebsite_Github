<p>This is located in a forest situated in the landing path (during west/northwest winds) of Frankfurt's airport, only a few hundred metres from the point of touchdown. It is in close proximity to two major motorways and a highly-frequented railway line. In many regards, this is a place laden with social and political connotations and implications: Noise pollution issues, crime statistics, employment rates, real estate prices, cold war games are all inextricably linked to this place that is technically a borough of the city. It is also an incredible, even intimidating soundspace.<p>

<p>While at first sight/listen the space appears to suggest the liminality between domesticated nature and industrialised traffic, to me the liminal lies in the constant passing, and more vividly in the transition from the global to the local - and vice versa.<p>

<p>It is a space where transit, transition, and the mechanicised connectedness of the distant and the nearby become audible in the most forceful way.<p>
