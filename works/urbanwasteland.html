  	<h1>It's Only Urban Wasteland</h1>

<p>This is located in the area where Frankfurt's central freight station used to be. An entirely new district of housing estates, commerce, and leisure areas is built to replace the abandoned site. Blocks of high-priced apartments, already inhabited, buildings in construction, and recently-opened supermarkets sit next to each other, sharing the space with barren, dug-up fields and new areas of parkland.<p>

<p>It is on the threshold between wasteland and shiny upper middle-class urban dwellings, complete with quickly-injected infrastructure. Its liminal condition is that of patches of new residential areas bordering on uninhabited urban space.<p>

<p>Its sound is that of a city being constructed on an open field, its yet few inhabitants rendered silent by the sounds of building work travelling through vast open spaces.<p>
