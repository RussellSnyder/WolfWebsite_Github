<p>This is located underneath a motorway bridge that passes through a vast green space, on which several districts border. The parkland and small woods are both a zone of leisure activities, as they are a shortcut for cyclists and walkers to move from one area of the city to another. Several cycling and footpaths cross underneath the bridge, as does a railway line.</p>

<p>Like the location for "Music From Airports", this is a place of passing, no one stays underneath the bridge. With its symmetrical columns it looks like a temple of movement: People moving in and out of the city, and from one urban space to another constantly. Yet at the same time, with its rigid structures and the constant traffic noise from overhead there is a feeling of stasis about it. If the green space is a threshold to be passed moving from one populated area to another, the bridge is a threshold within this space. The liminal space between entering and leaving, both in constant simultaneity.</p>

<p>Sonically, the ebb and flow of broadband traffic noise is underscored by the rhythmic, tom-tom-like sound of vehicles running over the bridge joints. In a reversal of the acousmatic, passing cyclists and walkers can be seen but almost never heard.</p>
