<p>This is an excerpt of a live performance on August 18th, 2014 at Alison House, Edinburgh, UK. Unlike the other three performances this took place in front of an audience, using pre-recorded material - i.e. a field recording captured close to my home in Frankfurt on a Summer's day. As in the all the pieces, the sound manipulations are entirely live. The original binaural recording was mixed for playback through a four-speaker setup on the day. The excerpt presented here is a stereo recording taken directly from the soundboard.<p>

				<h3>My urban sound environment - a personal encounter</h3>
				
				<p>Standing on the street facing fourth-floor balcony in my home, I cannot escape the socio-political implication of the space I am in. Turning my head from right to left, I can trace the thrust of gentrification. To my right, ubiquitous banking towers dominate the scene, overlooking Frankfurt's Westend, where a lot of the big money resides. Moving my view to the area immediately surrounding me, I'm aware that the house I live in is now one of the last few affordable places in the street, not yet taken over by the real estate market. Turning left, bland apartment blocks in the distance signal the direction of the money-driven push that cordons off ever more inner city spaces. They overlook a huge green space, hidden from my view - large enough that a motorway and a train line run through it, and that secret raves sometimes held there during the Summer can only be found by those in the know. It is an in-between space: Between city centre and outskirts, between extreme wealth and socio-economical struggle. Between being "in the sonic scene" and somehow being detached from it, due to its elevation, which sometimes yields a false feeling of critical distance. It is also a space between the private and the public.<p>  	
<p>During the day the sonic environment is both constrained and characterised by road traffic passing underneath. It is comparatively light traffic, but it limits the boundaries of my listening to a few hundred metres to either side. To my far right, trams pass by in silence. Walkers quietly and rhythmically punctuate the scene, like fragile droplets of rain. When cars pass, they are rendered silent, too, however close they are.<p>
<p>Passing bicycles, when I focus on their sounds, always fascinate me. The sound of their bared mechanicals seems to point to a bygone time, when things were built and fixed by hand. On many of them something is always squeaking, clicking, rattling. Their mechanicals sound so much more discrete than those of more modern means of transport. Their sound has a connotation of the subversive to me, saying "We're still here, and we are still the ultimate urban transport around the world." As if to underline their tenacity, the more old and wretched, the more audible they are. When their sounds are drowned out by other traffic, they reappear within seconds with their mechanical whispers.<p>			
<p>Then there are the airplanes. They are ubiquitous. They are both keynote and soundmark. They sonically signify being-at-home to me. There is no place in the urban agglomeration where they are not vehemently present. I am ambivalently attached to their sonic presence. If I do not hear planes in this space for a while during daytime, something must be awkward. I deduce changes in wind direction and weather conditions from the way they sound, as flight paths are changed accordingly.<p>			
<p>They transcend the lateral sound corridor of the street, no architectural structures being able to block off their sonic force. When I have the time and mood to focally listen to them, it can be a massively exciting experience - the slow fade-in as they approach, the emergence of a fundamental pitch and partials from the jet engines, its doppler-effect induced drop as they fly past, usually outbound, paired with frequency filtering that sounds as if a giant, ultra-responsive wah-wah were attached to them. At other times I cannot help but notice the relief of relative quietude when there is a pause in flights, as if a sonic weight is taken off my ears, freeing them to hear other sounds.<p>			
<p>Quasi-domestic sounds of shutting and opening doors, glass being thrown into recycling containers, keys on fobs, appear irregularly. With their sharp, percussive transients, they offer rhythmic structures against the flowing sounds of traffic. Human voices and birdsong occasionally filter through the dense low-end rumble and the phasing broadband whirr of passing cars. In an unintentional but curiously apt metaphor, it is these sounds that I perceive as most clearly defining the built space, as distinct reflections can be heard: This space belongs to and is defined by those who live here, arrive and depart from here, not those passing through.<p>
