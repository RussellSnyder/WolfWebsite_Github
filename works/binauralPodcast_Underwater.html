<p>"Underwater" consists of a series of five miniature pieces - hinting at the concept of a nano-podcast - that are my sonic interpretation of the late Leslie Harpold's short story by the same name. Interchangeable in sequence, these pieces are to be thought of as sonic manifestations of motifs found or hinted at in the text.
Technically, the pieces consist for the largest part of field recordings I gathered, assembled and manipulated using a variety of techniques. The sounds captured range from the very close-up and intimate, to the public, to the environmental - from the sonic micro- to the  macrocosm.
As all the material was recorded and mixed specifically for binaural playback, it should be listened to on headphones.

				<h3>07/20/02: Underwater</h3>
<p>I'd pay any price including all of my blood to get that feeling again.</p>
<p>Sliding into the pool at age 14, pure darkness, no lights on, a hot July night, in my emerald green Jantzen bathing suit with the white piping around the top. I know I'm not alone, but I don't remember who is with me. All I know is they have the presence of mind not to speak. My arms, legs and lungs know exactly what to do, work as a team to make it happen. I am so at home in the water I could swear I was swimming between molecules, light, lithe, and exactly where I belong.</p>
<p>Any questions I have, and at this point in my life, I have a lot, about what my body is supposed to look like or feel like disappear, wash off me and are sanitized in the chlorine. I twist below the surface, eyes open, and look at the stars hovering just above the surface of the pool through the water. I stay in the deep end, running no risk of scraping any part of me on the pool's concrete floor. Maybe I did laps the short way across, maybe I just did the backstroke in lopsided circles, but whatever I did, it was the right thing, the perfect thing, lasting forever. I might still be there. I don't remember collapsing with down in the bones exhaustion a full day and night of swimming brings into my bed, although I'm sure it eventually happened. I just know that I slid into the water in the dark and instantly had the feeling I was both who and where I was supposed to be, perfect and whole in the moment.</p>
<p>Any price.</p>
<p>Other moments have come close, but many involve other people and I know I can't recreate anything involving other souls to bending to my needs. I can only work my own psyche, and that unto itself is a feat. I've always been able, no matter how bleak the circumstances to muster a smile, however
fraudulent. Someone, somewhere along the line taught me the value of cheerfulness as a high virtue, especially under duress. I am excellent in a crisis, but tend to fall apart as soon as the moment of emergency is safely tucked away. It is a gift, as generally this approach affords me the luxury of undoing in private.</p>
<p>Once, on a red Schwinn Varsity ten speed I passed a car that was going about 35 miles an hour. I've gone over seventy on a snowmobile, and 120 in a car. These moments come close. I am a very safe driver and with the exception of the bike incident only undertake these speeds under highly controlled circumstances. This feeling of speed somehow relates. Maybe settling myself in a city that strips me of personal transportation is a subconscious safety valve. I rely on cab drivers and subway conductors to grant me passage from point to point. When I go to health club pools, the lights are always on, beaming down from concrete ceilings preventing ambitious stars from falling into the water.</p>
<p>Underwater, the weight of everything disappears. Even the smallest measures, like the imperceptible burden of a few ounces of hair are relieved. Underwater I am lighter and more powerful than should be possible. I don't even have a bathtub. It's time to trust myself a little more.</p>
