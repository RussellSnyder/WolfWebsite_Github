			<p>This website features some of my work as a practitioner of sound. In this, it covers a timeline from my early exploits in composing and recording electroacoustic music until my most recent efforts in sound art and design. <p>

<p>It is also a place for me to regularly share my personal reflection on all things sound, from thoughts on listening practice to philosophies of sound art.</p>
